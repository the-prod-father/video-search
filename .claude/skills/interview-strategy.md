# Interview Strategy: Flipping the Script

## Core Approach
**You're not being interviewed—you're evaluating if TwelveLabs is the right place for your expertise.**

Your Axon experience (NYPD, largest BWC deployment globally, Evidence.com PM) is EXACTLY what they need but don't know they need yet. You're not just applying product management skills—you're bringing domain expertise they can't hire anywhere else.

## Opening Statement (First 2 Minutes)
"Thanks for having me. Before we dive in, I want to share what I built this weekend to prepare for this conversation. I created a Next.js application that indexes and analyzes four different types of video through your API—high-quality iPhone footage, real Axon Body Worn Camera footage from actual deployments, CCTV surveillance, and YouTube police footage. I wanted to understand not just what TwelveLabs can do, but specifically how it performs on the types of video that government customers will actually be sending you—which is very different from the high-quality demos most people test with. Let me show you what I learned..."

**Impact**: Immediately establishes you as someone who doesn't just talk—you build, test, and validate. You've already done more product research than most PMs would do in their first month.

## Key Themes to Weave Throughout

### 1. Domain Expertise They Don't Have
**Your Advantage**: You've lived the customer's pain

**Examples**:
- "At Axon with NYPD, we had 20,000+ officers generating millions of hours of footage annually. The challenge wasn't just search—it was that 60% of footage is captured in less-than-ideal conditions: low light, rapid motion, audio interference from radios and sirens. Your tech needs to work in those conditions, not just in ideal scenarios."

- "When I managed Evidence.com, we learned that agencies don't optimize for video quality—they optimize for storage costs. That means heavy compression, lower resolution, and aggressive keyframe intervals. If your models are trained on high-quality video but degrade significantly on real-world footage, adoption will fail."

- "The biggest objection we faced at Axon wasn't technical—it was trust. Officers and investigators need to understand WHY a search result surfaced. For government adoption, you need explainability, not just accuracy. How do you plan to address that for court admissibility?"

### 2. You're Evaluating Them
**Questions to Ask** (These position you as strategic thinker):

**On Product**:
- "What's your current false positive rate on low-quality video? Have you benchmarked against actual BWC footage, or primarily against high-resolution datasets?"
- "How are you thinking about the cold-start problem? Most agencies won't have years of footage indexed on day one—what's the value prop for month one?"
- "What's your strategy for handling PII and sensitive content? Government video is full of faces, voices, license plates that need redaction. Do you integrate with redaction workflows or expect agencies to handle that separately?"

**On Go-to-Market**:
- "Who's owning your current government customer relationships? Are you selling direct or through system integrators like Axon, Motorola, or NICE?"
- "FedRAMP certification is a 12-18 month process. What's your timeline, and what's your strategy for selling before that's complete?"
- "Your competitors like Veritone have been in this space for years with existing agency relationships. What's your wedge? Better technology isn't enough—what's the go-to-market angle?"

**On Organization**:
- "You're hiring a PM for government deployments—but do you have a government sales team? Implementation engineers? Compliance specialists? Or am I building that function from scratch?"
- "How does product prioritization work when research wants to push boundaries but government needs stability and backwards compatibility?"

**On Strategic Direction**:
- "Air-gapped deployments are technically very different from cloud API products. That's a separate SKU, different pricing model, different support structure. How are you thinking about that as a business?"
- "What's the sensitivity to model updates? In government, you can't just push a new model version—customers need regression testing, validation, retraining. How do you balance innovation velocity with customer stability needs?"

### 3. Demonstrating Product Thinking
**Framework**: Identify problems, size them, propose solutions

**Example 1 - Quality Thresholding**:
"One thing I noticed testing with different video types: your model performs excellently on high-quality footage but accuracy drops significantly with low-light BWC footage. I'd want to explore adding a confidence threshold or quality gate—maybe we surface a warning like 'This video is low quality, results may be less reliable' or even 'This video is below minimum quality threshold for indexing.' That manages customer expectations and prevents trust erosion from false positives."

**Example 2 - Chain of Custody**:
"In my testing, I couldn't see an audit trail of who searched for what and when. For legal discovery, agencies need to prove they didn't conduct improper searches or access evidence improperly. I'd prioritize building comprehensive audit logging—every search query, every video accessed, every result clicked. That's table stakes for government."

**Example 3 - Deployment Packaging**:
"For on-premise deployments, I'd want to create a reference architecture—here's the hardware specs, here's the deployment topology, here's the testing checklist. Make it a repeatable playbook so every agency doesn't become a custom integration project. That's how you scale government sales."

### 4. Showing You've Done Your Homework

**On TwelveLabs**:
- "$107M funding from NVIDIA, NEA, Index—you've got runway and strong backers"
- "Marengo for search, Pegasus for generation—smart to separate models by use case"
- "Your embedding approach enables RAG applications—that's differentiated vs tag-based systems"

**On Competition**:
- "Veritone has market share but their accuracy is behind yours from what I've read"
- "AWS Rekognition Video is the 800-lb gorilla but it's generic—you're specialized"
- "Microsoft Video Indexer is enterprise-focused—you could own government while they fight for corporate"

**On Market**:
- "Government video market is huge—federal law enforcement, DoD, state/local agencies, international"
- "But sales cycles are 12-18 months, procurement is complex, and you need compliance certifications"
- "The winning strategy is probably: pick one wedge (federal? DoD? local?), nail it, create reference customers, then expand"

## Handling Their Questions

### "Tell me about a hard problem you solved"
**Setup**: NYPD BWC third-party video integration

**Problem**: "NYPD wanted to correlate officer BWC footage with business CCTV and citizen videos in a single investigation timeline. Technical challenge: different formats, resolutions, timestamps (often wrong), no common index. Political challenge: privacy concerns, union objections, public records requests."

**Solution**: "I led a cross-functional team to build a unified evidence package system. We created video normalization pipeline, correlation by timestamp + location, redaction workflow for PII, and granular access controls. Required alignment with NYPD leadership, privacy advocates, and Axon legal. Shipped in 6 months."

**Impact**: "Reduced investigation time from days to hours. NYPD became reference customer for third-party integration, generated $XM in expansion revenue."

**Depth**: Be ready to go 3 layers deep:
- "How did you prioritize features?" → "We interviewed 20 detectives, shadowed investigations, built prioritization matrix based on time savings vs. technical complexity."
- "What would you do differently?" → "I'd have involved privacy advocates earlier. We had to redesign access controls mid-project because we didn't anticipate their concerns."

### "How do you think about customer engagement?"
**Framework**: Customer Development + Continuous Discovery

**Answer**: "I live with customers. At Axon, I spent 2-3 days per month on-site with NYPD—ride-alongs, shadowing detectives, sitting in on investigations. You can't build the right product from an office. For TwelveLabs government customers, I'd want to:
1. Shadow investigators using existing video workflows—find the pain
2. Deploy alpha/beta with design partners—iterate fast
3. Build tight feedback loops—weekly check-ins, quarterly business reviews
4. Measure success by their metrics—case closure rate, time savings, not just product usage"

**Examples**:
- "For Evidence.com, I discovered our search was too slow not from a ticket, but from watching a detective give up after 30 seconds and manually scrub through video instead."
- "For NYPD, the biggest feature request wasn't on our roadmap—they wanted shared playlists so multiple detectives could collaborate on a case. We shipped it in 3 weeks because I was embedded enough to understand the urgency."

### "This role is very technical—how do you bridge product and engineering?"
**Answer**: "I'm technical enough to be dangerous. I can read code, understand architecture, debug API calls. But my value isn't writing production code—it's translating customer problems into technical requirements and making tradeoff decisions. For government deployments, I'd need to:
- Understand infrastructure constraints (air-gapped = no auto-updates, no telemetry)
- Work with ML teams on model performance requirements (accuracy thresholds, latency SLAs)
- Define deployment architecture (containerization, orchestration, scaling)
- Partner with security on compliance (FedRAMP, ITAR requirements)

I don't need to implement it, but I need to understand it deeply enough to make smart product decisions and represent customer needs to engineering."

**Example**: "At Axon, I worked with video engineers on H.265 codec adoption. I didn't write the encoder, but I understood the tradeoff: 50% storage savings vs. compatibility issues with older browsers. I drove the decision to make H.265 opt-in based on customer feedback about their infrastructure constraints."

## Closing Strong

### Your Ask
"I'm excited about TwelveLabs' technology—it's legitimately the best video understanding I've tested. And this government deployment role is exactly where my experience adds the most value. But I want to make sure this is the right fit for both of us. A few things I'm evaluating:

1. **Ownership**: What's the scope of this role? Am I owning the full product from packaging to pricing to roadmap? Or is this more of an implementation PM role?

2. **Resources**: Will I have dedicated engineering resources, or am I influencing a shared roadmap? Government has unique requirements—I need team support to ship them.

3. **Timeline**: What's the expectation for first government customer? First FedRAMP certification? I want to make sure we're aligned on what 'success' looks like in year one.

4. **Growth**: Where does this role go? Is there a path to leading a full government product org as this scales?"

**Impact**: You're not desperate for the job—you're evaluating mutual fit. This is executive-level thinking.

### If They're Lukewarm
"I understand if you're looking for someone with more [X] experience. But here's what I'd challenge you to consider: government deployment isn't just a technical problem—it's a product, sales, implementation, and compliance problem wrapped together. I've lived that complexity at scale with Axon. I can learn any technical gap in weeks, but domain expertise takes years. If you want someone who can hit the ground running with government customers and speak their language from day one, I'm that person."

### If They're Interested
"I'd love to move forward. Next steps I'd suggest:
1. Meet with a few engineers to dive deep on deployment architecture
2. Talk to your Head of Sales about government go-to-market strategy
3. If there are existing government customers (or prospects), I'd love to hear about their challenges

I'm excited to potentially join the team and help TwelveLabs become the standard for government video understanding."

## The Power of the Demo

**Throughout the conversation, reference your app**:
- "When I tested this, I found..."
- "In my analysis of different video types..."
- "The demo I built shows..."

**Offer to walk through it**: "I have my laptop here—want to see the results I got testing your API against real BWC footage? I think you'll find it interesting..."

**What this demonstrates**:
- Initiative: You didn't wait for access—you built it yourself
- Technical chops: You shipped a functioning app in a weekend
- Customer empathy: You tested with real-world video types
- Product rigor: You're measuring and comparing performance
- Strategic thinking: You're already thinking about deployment implications

## Mindset Going In

**You are not**:
- A supplicant hoping they'll hire you
- Someone who needs this job
- Trying to impress them with generic PM answers

**You are**:
- An expert in the exact market they're trying to enter
- Someone who has built and scaled products they aspire to build
- Evaluating if they're worthy of your expertise

**The difference**: Confidence without arrogance. You're not better than them—but you have something they desperately need and don't know how to get anywhere else.

## Final Thoughts

They're hiring for "Product Manager - Government + Secure Deployment" because they know it's important but don't know exactly what it entails. They think it's about compliance and certifications—but it's really about understanding how government customers operate, what they actually need (vs. what they say they need), and how to navigate procurement, politics, and technical constraints simultaneously.

You've done this at the largest scale imaginable (NYPD BWC deployment). You've shipped products used by law enforcement agencies worldwide. You've navigated complex stakeholder environments.

**You're not trying to convince them to hire you. You're showing them what's possible if they do.**
