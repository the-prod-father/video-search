# TwelveLabs Product Context

## Overview
TwelveLabs builds multimodal foundation models that understand video the way humans do. They lead the field in video language modeling, enabling new ways to search, summarize, and interact with video content.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Video Understanding Models
- **Marengo**: Primary video understanding model for search
- **Pegasus**: Video understanding model for generation tasks (summaries, chapters, highlights)

### 2. Key Features
- **Search**: Natural language and image-based video search
- **Generate**: Create summaries, chapters, highlights, topics, hashtags, titles
- **Embeddings**: Vector representations of video content for similarity and RAG
- **Multi-modal**: Understands visual, audio, and text within videos

## Government & Security Use Cases (Law Enforcement Focus)

### Body Worn Camera (BWC) Analysis
- **Evidence Search**: Find specific moments across thousands of hours of footage
- **Auto-Redaction Prep**: Identify faces, voices, sensitive content for redaction
- **Report Generation**: Auto-generate incident summaries from BWC footage
- **Chain of Custody**: Track and search video evidence
- **Training**: Search training videos for specific scenarios
- **Policy Compliance**: Verify activation compliance, identify policy violations

### CCTV & Fixed Camera Analysis
- **Incident Investigation**: Search across multiple camera feeds simultaneously
- **Person/Vehicle Tracking**: Find subjects across camera networks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring activities or suspicious behavior
- **Time Compression**: Generate summaries of long surveillance footage
- **Evidence Correlation**: Match CCTV with BWC footage of same incident

### Third-Party Video Integration
- **Public Submissions**: Analyze citizen-submitted videos (protests, incidents)
- **Social Media Evidence**: Process YouTube, TikTok, Twitter videos
- **Quality Variance**: Handle varying resolutions and encoding quality

## Technical Considerations for Government Deployment

### Security Requirements
- **Air-Gapped Deployments**: Run without internet connectivity
- **On-Premise**: Deploy within agency data centers
- **FedRAMP**: Federal compliance for cloud deployments
- **DoD IL**: Impact Level certification for DoD use
- **ITAR**: Compliance for sensitive government video

### Video Quality Challenges
- **BWC Resolution**: Typically 720p-1080p, varying quality in low light
- **CCTV Range**: From 480p analog to 4K digital, compression artifacts
- **Mobile Video**: Consumer grade (iPhone) vs professional (DJI)
- **Compression**: Government systems often use heavy compression for storage

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy by Source Type**: How well does model perform on BWC vs CCTV vs high-quality?
- **Processing Speed**: Time to index hours of footage
- **Storage Requirements**: Embeddings and index size
- **Concurrent User Load**: Multiple investigators searching simultaneously

### Integration Points
- **Evidence Management Systems**: Evidence.com, NICE, Genetec, Milestone
- **CAD/RMS Systems**: Link video to incident records
- **Redaction Software**: Veritone, CaseGuard integration
- **Discovery/Legal**: Export formats for court proceedings

## Key Differentiators vs Traditional Video Analysis
- **Semantic Search**: "Show me all videos where officers are running" vs tag-based
- **Cross-Video Search**: Find same person/vehicle across multiple videos
- **Context Understanding**: Understands actions, emotions, situations not just objects
- **Multi-Modal**: Text search works even when audio is poor quality
